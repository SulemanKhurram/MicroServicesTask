# MicroServicesTask
This project contains three different microservices that will contact with each other to convert an xml file to csv data.

This Gui component will take XML file(s) as input and will pass them on to xml-parser service to parse the tables out of it.

Requirements:

RabbitMq  
AspNet Core  
Docker (if you want to use docker, docker file is provided)  

Following are some screenshots to display the working of these services.
